# Cricket Australia add-on for Kodi

http://aussieaddons.com/addons/cricket/

This add-on provides a simple list of available live streams of Cricket
matches available for viewing in Australia.

The content is only available within Australia, but it is possible to use
this service outside of Australia by using Smart DNS or VPN geo-unblocking
tools.

NOTE: If you are in Australia and are having issues streaming, you may need to
disable any Smart DNS or VPN tools.

## Current status

Working :+1:

## Installation

Follow the Aussie Add-ons repository
[installation guide](http://aussieaddons.com/installation/)
to set up the Aussie Add-ons repository.

Once the repository is installed, you can install the add-on through the
Kodi Add-on manager by accessing the menus:

 * System ->
 * Settings ->
 * Add-ons ->
 * Install from repository ->
 * Aussie Add-ons ->
 * Video add-ons ->
 * Cricket Australia ->
 * Install

The Kodi wiki also has a nice guide on
[installing Add-ons via the Add-on manager](http://kodi.wiki/view/Add-on_manager).

Installing directly is not supported, unless you have the Aussie Add-ons/XBMC
CatchupTV AU repository already configured, as this add-on has some
dependencies that must be installed before it will work.
